# Simple Data Structures Implementation and Applications

_Data Structures – University of Tehran_

Build foundational skills in implementing and using essential data structures including linked lists, queues, and stacks, followed by practical algorithmic challenges utilizing these structures.

## Objectives

-   Complete implementation of core methods for linked lists, queues, and stacks based on given templates.
    
-   Understand dynamic data structure manipulation and behavior under various operations.
    
-   Apply data structures to solve refactoring and simulation problems.
    
-   Practice problem-solving with lists, queues, and stacks through algorithmic scenarios.
    

## Tasks

1.  **Warm-up: Implement Queue, Stack, and LinkedList Methods**  
    Complete the given class methods for enqueue, dequeue, push, pop, insert, reverse, and others according to provided specifications.
    
2.  **Refactor Code Indentation (Refactoring Task)**  
    Transform deeply indented pseudo-code (Painthon language) into a flattened version by replacing nested scopes with function calls to improve readability.
    
3.  **Sewer Battle Simulation**  
    Simulate encounters among rats moving in a line within a sewer pipe, resolving fights based on direction and power, to determine survivors.
    
4.  **Nighttime Library Book Selection**  
    Model the process of selecting the best visible books in a sliding window from a shelf, simulating a scenario of repeated book replacements.
    
5.  **Reversing City Neighborhood Groups**  
    Reverse the order of nodes in groups of a specified size within a linked list, simulating reordering of connected houses in a city.
