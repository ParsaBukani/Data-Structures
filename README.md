# Data Structures

This repository contains a series of programming projects developed for the course  
**“Data Structures”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Fall 1403**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Hesham Feili**, **Engineer Mostafa Amiri**.

## Overview

The projects focus on the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python. Topics covered include:

-   **Array processing & query optimization**
    
-   Application of **stacks, queues, heaps, trees, and hash maps** to solve computational problems
    
-   **Online algorithms** (e.g., median maintenance with heaps)
    
-   **Graph traversal & connectivity**
    
-   **Efficient sorting & searching techniques**
