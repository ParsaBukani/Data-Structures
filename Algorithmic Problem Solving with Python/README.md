# Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python

_Data Structures – University of Tehran_

Explore fundamental algorithmic problem solving and Python programming through four distinct challenges emphasizing parsing, validation, traversal, and error handling.

## Objectives

-   Develop proficiency in Python syntax and control structures for algorithmic tasks.
    
-   Apply string parsing and numerical conversion under constrained conditions.
    
-   Validate complex data structures such as Sudoku boards.
    
-   Implement matrix traversal algorithms.
    
-   Design robust programs with controlled error detection and management.
    

## Tasks

1.  **Library Number Extraction**  
    Parse input strings to extract the first valid signed 32-bit integer, respecting whitespace and sign conventions, clamping values outside representable range.
    
2.  **Hamzeh’s Sudoku Validator**  
    Verify the integrity of a partially filled Sudoku grid ensuring rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain no repeated digits (1-9), considering only filled cells.
    
3.  **Ras the Snail’s Spiral Traverse**  
    Simulate spiral matrix traversal from the top-left corner, outputting the sequence of elements visited until the entire matrix is covered.
    
4.  **Danger Zone Error Handling**  
    Implement a command-driven system for list operations that gracefully handles division by zero, null references, and out-of-range accesses with specified output messages.
