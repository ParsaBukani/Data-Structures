# Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, and DSU

_Data Structures – University of Tehran_

Solve three advanced graph and tree problems using Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Disjoint Set Union (DSU). The problems simulate competitive programming challenges and require efficient traversal, component detection, and propagation of values under large input constraints.

## Objectives

-   Implement BFS and DFS for graph traversal and property calculation.
    
-   Apply DSU to efficiently manage connected components.
    
-   Perform value aggregation and propagation in trees with update queries.
    
-   Optimize algorithms to handle input sizes up to 2×1052 \times 10^5 elements.
    

## Tasks

1.  **ACM Contest Rooms**  
    In a graph representing ACM contest rooms and corridors, find the number of connected components. Each vertex is a room, and each edge is a corridor. Using DSU, compute how many separate groups of rooms exist.
        
2.  **Value Broadcasting in a Tree**  
    You are given a rooted tree where updates are applied to nodes, increasing their values. Each update value propagates down the tree from the updated node to all of its descendants. After all updates, report the final value of each node.

3. **Permutation Swap Analysis**
	You are given a permutation p[1…N] and M swap operations. Each operation is a pair (ai​,bi​) meaning **swap the elements at positions** a_i​ and b_i​. Perform all swaps in the given order. At the end, determine how many indices i satisfy p[i]=i (i.e., how many elements are in their original position).
