# Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

_Data Structures – University of Tehran_

This project deepens your understanding of advanced data structures and algorithmic challenges, including min-heaps, Huffman trees, binary search trees, segment trees, and string manipulation algorithms.

## Objectives

-   Implement and operate a **MinHeap** data structure with robust error handling.
    
-   Build and use a **Huffman Tree** for text compression analysis.
    
-   Implement a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with insertion and traversal methods.
    
-   Solve range query problems using **Segment Trees**.
    
-   Perform string concatenation optimizations based on prefix and suffix matching.
    
-   Practice solving complex algorithmic problems involving data structures and string processing.

## Tasks

**1. Min Heap, Huffman Tree, and BST Implementation**   
    Implement the following data structures with their respective functionalities:
    -   **Min Heap:** Support heapify, push, pop, and finding the minimum child. Raise exceptions on invalid operations.
    -   **Huffman Tree:** Build the Huffman tree given letters and their frequencies and compute compressed lengths.
    -   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Support insertions and traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder).
    

**2. Median Queries on Subarrays**   
    Given a sequence of integers, answer queries asking for the median of elements in a specified subarray `[l, r]`. For each query    

**3. Counting Covered Points in Intervals**    
    You are given `n` intervals `[l_i, r_i]`. For each integer point `x` in the range covered by these intervals, determine how many intervals cover it. Output the count of points covered by exactly `k` intervals for all `k`.

**4. String Concatenation and Simplification**   
    Given a list of strings, concatenate them into a single string and simplify it by removing all spaces. Output the resulting concatenated string.
